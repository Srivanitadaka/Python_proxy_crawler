# Python_proxy_crawler

A high-performance, asynchronous web crawler built in Python using `aiohttp` and `BeautifulSoup`. This crawler can efficiently scrape web pages, handle dynamic content, respect `robots.txt`, rotate proxies and user agents, and is designed for scalability and flexibility. 

ðŸ“‹ Features
- **Asynchronous Crawling**: Leverages `aiohttp` and `asyncio` for faster, non-blocking requests.
- **Proxy Rotation**: Automatically rotates proxies to prevent IP blocking.
- **User-Agent Spoofing**: Rotates user-agent strings using the `fake_useragent` library to mimic real browsers.
- **JavaScript Support**: (Optional) Uses `Selenium` or `Playwright` for handling JavaScript-heavy websites.
- **Respects Robots.txt**: Complies with the site's `robots.txt` to prevent unwanted requests.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Handles errors gracefully and logs all activity, including failures, retries, and successes.
- **Rate Limiting**: Avoids overloading servers with configurable delays between requests.
- **Multi-threading**: (Optional) Supports multi-threading for more demanding crawls.
- **Extensible**: Easily customizable for different use cases, such as scraping structured data or crawling specific domains.
